    <h1 class="title"> Underpaid? Resign!</h1>
    <p class=date> Thu 04 September 2014 </p>
    <p>Today's post is courtesy of former Avis CEO Robert Townsend's plain speaking memoir of business and career tips <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Up-Organization-Corporation-Stifling-Strangling/dp/0787987751">Up the Organization</a>: How to Stop the Corporation from Stifling People and Strangling Profits. It's a totally irreverent and fun send-up on turning upside down those frustrating bureaucratic environments that many of us have resigned ourselves to. Not just humourous but practical too.</p>
<p>And speaking of practical and resigning, that brings us to the topic of the day. Inspired by Townsend's advice, I did something ballsy today. I resigned from work. Sort of. I handed my boss the following letter:</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title first">Letter of Resignation</p>
<p>Dear (boss),</p>
<p>Recently I have come to the conclusion that my compensation does not reflect my contributions to the companyâ€™s business and culture or the supply and demand situation in Singapore for comparable skills. There is a world of opportunity outside the company. Therefore, I am tendering my resignation.</p>
<p>I am happy to consider re-employment with the company with improved compensation in either a full time position or as a contractor. So, I intend to re-apply for my position when it is advertised. This will allow the company to compare my candidacy against other applicants in terms of experience, ability, and salary expectations. I think that you will find that I am the best candidate for the challenges ahead in building up the organization.</p>
<p>In case I overestimate my contributions and potential, I am also happy to know that for a fact and move on to a new career as a freelancing professional. In which case, I invite you to propose a suitable date for my last day of employment that will allow a smooth handover of my responsibilities.</p>
<p>I do appreciate the experience of working for you the past four years and would like to thank you for coaching me to be a better manager.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,
ginjera</p>
</div>
<p>I had gotten tired of getting 3-4% annual increments for the past four years and decided to do something about it. I had been thinking about it since reading Townsend's cheeky book. A mid-year review seemed like the best time to do it. I felt a little uncomfortable to broach the topic, and simply said,&quot;(Boss) today's one on one meeting is gonna be a little weird. (Pause) Today, I resign. Sort of. Here. Read this.&quot; The discussion flowed easily after that. The boss didn't take offense and indicated that salary negotiations are fair game. And asked if I had a number in mind. I asked for 20%.</p>
<p>I'll find out in 2 weeks' time if this negotiation bears fruit. Either way, this gambit has already paid off for me. I had been putting this off for a while as I fretted about forgoing my performance bonus by leaving the job. I'm happy I plucked up the courage, shoved my doubts aside and took bold action. I think it's better to commit the sin of commission than the sin of omission.</p>
<p>For the curious, here's what Townsend has to say about this topic:</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title first"><strong>Underpaid</strong></p>
<p>Some good people become badly underpaid. If you're in this spot, but likeyour work, cheer up; all is not lost.</p>
<p>Resign. Go to the personnel department. Fillin the forms. Apply for your old position. Under &quot;salary objective&quot;, put down what you should be paid.</p>
<p>If your diagnosis is correct, you'll be far and away the best-qualified applicabnt for your old job and cheap at this new price. When I bullied a griping friend into doing this, he ended up with a 30 per cent pay raise, in a company that didn't believe in paying people.</p>
<p>If they don't rehire you because of &quot;regulations&quot;, it's time you left the company anyway, because they've got the tail on the front of the dog.</p>
</div>
<p>Like I said, irreverent and practical :) Go get a copy and read it. Now.</p>
