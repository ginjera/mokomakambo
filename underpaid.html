    <h1 class="title"> Underpaid? Resign!</h1>
    <p class=date> Thu 04 September 2014 </p>
    <p>Today's post is courtesy of former Avis CEO Robert Townsend's plain speaking memoir of business and career tips <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Up-Organization-Corporation-Stifling-Strangling/dp/0787987751">Up the Organization</a>: How to Stop the Corporation from Stifling People and Strangling Profits. It's a totally irreverent and fun send-up on turning upside down those frustrating bureaucratic environments that many of us have resigned ourselves to. Not just humourous but practical too.</p>
<p>And speaking of practical and resigning, that brings us to the topic of the day. Inspired by Townsend's advice, I did something ballsy today. I resigned from work. Sort of. I handed my boss the following letter:</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title first">Letter of Resignation</p>
<p>Dear (boss),</p>
<p>Recently I have come to the conclusion that my compensation does not reflect my contributions to the company’s business and culture or the supply and demand situation in Singapore for comparable skills. There is a world of opportunity outside the company. Therefore, I am tendering my resignation.</p>
<p>I am happy to consider re-employment with the company with improved compensation in either a full time position or as a contractor. So, I intend to re-apply for my position when it is advertised. This will allow the company to compare my candidacy against other applicants in terms of experience, ability, and salary expectations. I think that you will find that I am the best candidate for the challenges ahead in building up the organization.</p>
<p>In case I overestimate my contributions and potential, I am also happy to know that for a fact and move on to a new career as a freelancing professional. In which case, I invite you to propose a suitable date for my last day of employment that will allow a smooth handover of my responsibilities.</p>
<p>I do appreciate the experience of working for you the past four years and would like to thank you for coaching me to be a better manager.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,
ginjera</p>
</div>
<p>I had gotten tired of getting 3-4% annual increments for the past four years and decided to do something about it. I had been thinking about it since reading Townsend's cheeky book. A mid-year review seemed like the best time to do it. I felt a little uncomfortable to broach the topic, and simply said,&quot;(Boss) today's one on one meeting is gonna be a little weird. (Pause) Today, I resign. Sort of. Here. Read this.&quot; The discussion flowed easily after that. The boss didn't take offense and gamely said that salary negotiations are fair game. And asked if I had a number in mind. I asked for 20%.</p>
<p>I'll find out in 2 weeks' time if this negotiation bears fruit. Either way, this gambit has already paid off for me. I had been putting this off for a while as I fretted about forgoing my performance bonus by leaving the job. I'm happy I plucked up the courage, shoved my doubts aside and took bold action. I think it's better to commit the sin of commission than the sin of omission.</p>
<p>For the curious, here's what Townsend has to say about this topic:</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title first"><strong>Underpaid</strong></p>
<p>Some good people become badly underpaid. If you're in this spot, but like your work, cheer up; all is not lost.</p>
<p>Resign. Go to the personnel department. Fill in the forms. Apply for your old position. Under &quot;salary objective&quot;, put down what you should be paid.</p>
<p>If your diagnosis is correct, you'll be far and away the best-qualified applicant for your old job and cheap at this new price. When I bullied a griping friend into doing this, he ended up with a 30 per cent pay raise, in a company that didn't believe in paying people.</p>
<p>If they don't rehire you because of &quot;regulations&quot;, it's time you left the company anyway, because they've got the tail on the front of the dog.</p>
</div>
<p>Like I said, irreverent and practical :) Go get a copy and read it. Now.</p>
