Mokomakambo! is my learning blog as I figure my way around desktop linux, web development, and other related technologies which catch my obsession. I started my journey in 2008 with PCLinuxOS and had been making the odd how-to notes in little text files scattered across several machines. Capturing learnings here will make future referencing easier and also serve as my small contribution to the weird and wonderful world of free and open source software. Its philosophies. Its technologies. Its politics. Its *spirit*. I've been much entertained and have benefited greatly from poking around the collective knowledge bubbling in various nooks and crannnies of the internet. This is my own nook and cranny. Welcome!

Beware that these are the ramblings of an amateur hacker. I'm a chemical engineer by training and have no formal computer science experience. In my day job, I'm a project manager for a pharmaceutical company - planning and executing capital projects, developing and managing project and portfolio governance systems and tools, and training and coaching my colleagues in the dark arts of project management. In my free time, I geek out to the cornucopia of curiousities that is FOSS.

This blog is compiled using the `Pelican <http://docs.getpelican.com>`_ static site generator. Thanks to `Circuidipity's excellent Pelican tutorial  <http://www.circuidipity.com/pelican.html>`_ and the magic of `ghp-import <https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import>`_ this static blog is now hosted on Github Pages.

In case you're wondering, Mokomakambo is just a word I made up. I like that it sounds dynamic and vaguely African.
