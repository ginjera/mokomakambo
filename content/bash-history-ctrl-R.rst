Wow, bash is cool. A couple of days ago I discovered a simple way to search through bash history by piping the `history` command through `grep` for a favourite old command and then follow through with a copy-n-paste. Turns out there's an even simpler way to achieve that. Bash has a built in search function!

Simply press `ctrl-R` and start typing the first characters of that command you're looking for. Bash will start matching it with the most recent occurence. Pressing `ctrl-R` again and bash will scroll backwards to the next most recent one. When you find it, press `Enter` to re-execute that command or use left- or right-arrow keys to start editing the command.

Very. Very. Cool.
