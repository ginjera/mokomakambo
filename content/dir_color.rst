I use CentOS 6.5 on my personal laptop. For the longest time, I lived with the awful colour defaults for the ls command. Certain directories default to blue text on green background.

    :alt: Awful default directory colours
    :align: center

    Arghh, my eyes! Please sir, it hurts!

It occurred to me recently that there must be a text file somewhere that I could tweak to make this more readable. 

Lo and behold, here's the file that does the trick: ``/etc/DIR_COLORS``. And there are nice helpful comments, which tell us that we can adjust 3 elements:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Below are the color init strings for the basic file types. A color init
    # string consists of one or more of the following numeric codes:
    # Attribute codes:
    # 00=none 01=bold 04=underscore 05=blink 07=reverse 08=concealed
    # Text color codes:
    # 30=black 31=red 32=green 33=yellow 34=blue 35=magenta 36=cyan 37=white
    # Background color codes:
    # 40=black 41=red 42=green 43=yellow 44=blue 45=magenta 46=cyan 47=white

Scanning through that file, I found the blue (34) on green (42) culprit:

.. code-block:: bash
   
    OTHER_WRITABLE 34;42 # dir that is other-writable (o+w) and not sticky

Rather than mess around with ``/etc/DIR_COLORS``, I made a copy at ``~/.dircolors`` and changed the settings for OTHER_WRITABLE to 01;35: 

.. figure:: {filename}/images/Ahh-much-better.png
    :alt: Bold magenta folders
    :align: center

    Ahhh, purple folders... exactly what the optometrist ordered
