I've been watching this Lynda.com `video tutorial`_ on the topic of courageous leadership. I like the instructor, Bob McGannon; he's energetic, articulates clearly, and has some convincing ideas. One of these ideas concerns a creative way to say 'no'. The tip is to get the requestor to say 'no'. 

For example, you're running an initiative and someone has an idea that they want to add to your initiative. Say ,"Yes, and... that will probably cost us another six hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Do *you* have that in your budget?" They then say 'no' and you can engage in a conversation about their 'no' and how we're gonna get the money to do this great idea. Haha, nice piece of verbal **tai-chi** there :) I have to try this at work.
