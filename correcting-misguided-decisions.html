    <h1 class="title"> Courageous Leadership: Correcting Misguided Decisions</h1>
    <p class=date> Tue 02 September 2014 </p>
    <p>Another nugget from Bob McGannon's courageous leadership video. This time it's about challenging decisions from the top without being confrontational.</p>
<p>Bob shares a story about Charles, a project manager in the Army Corps of Engineers, whose project has been canned by superiors in Pentagon. Charles believes that the decision is misguided based on the type of questions he and his peers on the program had been asked in a questionairre on the programme. And sends out an email to try and correct his superiors' assumptions.</p>
<p>He basically tells them that: &quot;I understand the nature of the questions you asked. And I understand the nature of what's happening with this project and programme. But if I were in your position, there are some other information I would want to understand as well.&quot; He then lists a few questions that he would have asked and provided the answers. And ends the note with: &quot;I hope you find this useful.&quot;</p>
<p>Charles doesn't ask for anything. But rather he plants the seed of doubt to correct the misguided assumptions of his superiors. What Charles managed to do was put more truth on the table and add perspective to a decision, without challenging directly.</p>
<p>I find this simple communication strategy quite inspiring. In the last two years, I have adopted a more direct confrontational style at work when trying to resolve disagreements. Basically I seek to beat the other party into submission by showing up the flaws in their argument. Sometimes publically. I think this is a response to years of being a quiet introvert.</p>
<p>What Bob is introducing here is a more elegant way to turn a situation around. And this migh tjust come in handy. I expect a capital project at work may be canclled, I susperct, to make the numbers for the year. This would be a misguided decision in my opinion and detrimental to the morale of the organisation. If it does happen, I'll try to do a 'Charles'.</p>
